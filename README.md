My Free Music Player

This is a simple website to search and play music from YouTube for free. You can use the search box at the top to find songs and play them instantly. There is also an AI search box to get music facts and general information. The design is clean, colorful, and easy for anyone to use.

Type a song or artist and press the search button to start playing music. The website updates songs every time you search because it finds the latest results from YouTube. The AI box uses Wikipedia and gives you quick answers about music or other topics.

Features coming soon include login with Google, Discord, or phone. You will get music suggestions and personal playlists. There will be more sound effects and different styles for listening. You can even choose how the website looks and feels.

This project is made for anyone who wants an easy way to play music, learn, and have fun. No advanced skills or paid software required. Anyone can use, share, and build on this idea.
